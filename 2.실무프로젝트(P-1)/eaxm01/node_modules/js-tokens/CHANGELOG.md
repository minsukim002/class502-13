### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###

- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.

These are the breaking changes:

- `'/a/s'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['/', 'a', '/', 's']`, but
  `['/a/s']`. (There are of course other variations of this.)
- Code that rely on some token objects not having the `closed` property could
  now behave differently.
